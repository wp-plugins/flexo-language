need to make php file that is located inside the theme, it must be said lang_ (languages ??which will translate as lang_en.php)
 and contains the following code:

<?php $__FL_DICT__ = array(

       'cat' => 'Katze',
       'dog' =>	'Hund',
	.............
);?>
where 'cat' => 'Katze' 'regulations is a word and its translation.

in function.php to add the code:
<?php if(class_exists('flexoLanguage')){

	$f	=	dirname(__FILE__);
	
	if(!flexoLanguage::is_set_language())
		flexoLanguage::set_language('en');//selected language
		
	flexoLanguage::add_dictionary($f);
	
	function _l($key){
		return flexoLanguage::_($key);
	}
}
else{
	function _l($key){return $key;}
}?>

and everywhere in the code where you write words you want to have a translation in another language and place:
_l('cat');
